# 2024 FRQ Question 2
---
 # This question was about...
- A game that has two teams and we are in charge of making a score keeping method.
- When one team scores 0 then the team that can score switches
- A score reporting method that is included.
- Writing a code that simulates the quantity of food left in the feeder in one day with `numBirds` or a bear.
---
 # Struggles with this question...
- Understanding the rules and making which team should get the point in the scores for each teams.
- Switch the team scoring when a team wins no point.
---
 # Prior experience that helped...
- Demorgan's law lesson was really helpful. I made the instance variable of `private boolean isTeam1Active = true` then when team one scores no point, `isTeam1Active = !isTeam1Active` to show scoring team changing.

 # What I learned by doing this question...
- I learned to work with conditions to change use of a counter when the conditon is met.
- Demorgan's law works really well with boolean assignment.
