# 2024 FRQ Question 3
---
 # This question was about...
- The question asks to create a code that will check if an array of String is a word chain.
- A word chain is when the previous String in an array is found in the current String of the array.
- The second part of the question asks to return an ArrayList of String by filling it with String that have a target String in an ArrayList of String called wordList and remove all String that does not contain this target String while taking out the target String from the Strings that do have it.
---
 # Struggles with this question...
- Managing to loop through the right index while checking if the previous is a part of the current.
- Checking that a string begins with the target while truncating the String.
---
 # Prior experience that helped...
- The many practices of tracing code and going over the String method substring().
---
 # What I learned by doing this question...
- The index that a code finds a target + the length of the target can truncate the String and return the remaining String with substring().
