# 2024 FRQ Question 1
---
 # This question was about...
- A feeder for birds and sometimes bears
- In a day there is a 95% chance for appearance of all birds to each eat randomly from 10-50 count of food
- In a day there is a 5% chance for the appearance of a bear to eat all the food.
- Writing a code that simulates the quantity of food left in the feeder in one day with `numBirds` or a bear.
---
 # Struggles with this question...
- The difficult part about this code was understanding what numbers to use for `Math.random()`.
- Maintaining the food count to be accurate but greater than or equal to 0 was another criteria.
---
 # Prior experience that helped...
- The review in class about the `Math.random()` syntax.
- The loop exercise that goes over the while loop.
---
 # What I learned by doing this question...
- I learned to maintaining count while choosing the correct range for `Math.random()` conditions
- To keep an eye out to break when condition of `currentFood == 0` is `true`.
